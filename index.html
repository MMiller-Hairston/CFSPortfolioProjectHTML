        <img src="https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/17053853?v=3&u=b8347f824c03a9dc24384b5bca45557952abf02b&s=400">

        <p>My name is Michael Miller and I am a developer in Phoenix, Arizona. I enjoy long walks on the beach and eating smores around the campfire. In my free time I build birdhouses and train in the art of Tae-Kwon-Do.</p>

        <h1>My Background</h1>

        <p> I graduated with a  B.A. in Digital Culture from Arizona State University and a minor in Business. I also attended Coder Camps in September of 2016 to further my developmental career. Now I am currently working at Coder Camps as a creative engineer. </p>

        <h1>Why Programming?</h1>

        <p>I found a passion in programming throughout my time at Arizona State and I wanted to continue to pursue that. That is how I ended up at Coder Camps. The course allowed me to continue to pursue my passion without returning to school for another degree in two years' time. </p>
